This is the *official* **osu!player** (Avalonia) repository and is mainly developed by [@Founntain](https://github.com/Founntain), with help of [@Cesan](https://github.com/Cesan).  
This repository will be a complete rewrite of the osu!player plus so keep in mind that this all here is WIP, with the *ultimate goal to go cross-platform*.  
So if we speak osu!player in this repository we mean the Avalonia (this) version. If you want to refer to other versions of the osu!player mention them by their name, either osu!player **plus** or osu!player **legacy** (osu!player versions before the plus)  

osu!player is a music player for *osu!* with the focus of playing your osu! songs **without having to start osu!**.

If you want to contribute, feel free to fork the repository, read the [contributing information](https://github.com/Founntain/osuplayer.git) and head to the [official osu!player discord](https://discord.gg/RJQSc5B). There you can add all valuable ideas and discuss other stuff regarding development.
