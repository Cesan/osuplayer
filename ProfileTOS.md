# osu!player profile TOS üìã
We will be completely honest with you. When you create a profile you allow us to save the information you just entered and store it until you delete your profile.

*You always have the right to delete your profile by using the delete option where you edit your profile!*

### Tell me, what do you collect from me 
Well, let us make it quick and tell you everything.  
Because we can and want you to know what we save and do with your information.

**Example profile**
```
{
  "id": "<your GUID (not database ID)>",
  "name": "<your username>",
  "description": "<your description>",
  "role": <your userrole>,
  "joinDate": "<the date your joined>",
  "level": <your current level>,
  "xp": <current xp progress>,
  "totalXp": <totalxp>,
  "hasXpLock": <if true you are not able to gain XP>,
  "version": <the version you use, DEPRECATED>,
  "versionDate": "<the version you use>",
  "lastSeen": "<when you were the last time online>",
  "osuProfile": "<the osu!profile ID you gaved us>",
  "songsPlayed": <the amount of songs you played>,
  "isDonator": <if you are a donator>,

}
```
Your activity, which includes: XP, songs played, updates on whether you're listening to songs while logged in  
The above information is publicly visible by visiting our [stats page](https://stats.founntain.dev) or by viewing profiles inside the client.

That's all the data we store of you in our *database*, when you delete your profile the above object of you is gone and erased.  
Your profile picture will also be deleted when you delete your profile.

### ‚òùÔ∏è Some rules
Don't post anything NSFW, hate-/harmful in your description or somewhere else in the client. This also includes your profile picture. *(sorry about that, but no anime titties as profile picture)*  

If you create a profile and don't reach level 2 in 24 hours **we have the right to delete your profile**.  
Please only create an account if you intend to use the player and its user feature as intended.  
You don't need a profile if you do not want to use the user features, such as collecting XP and statistics!  
If your profile was deleted, you will still be able to create a new profile if you believe you will use it as intended.

If you agree and accept the above, you can continue creating your profile.  
***Have fun and enjoy your stay.***
